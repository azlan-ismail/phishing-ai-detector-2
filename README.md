# 🛡️ Phishing Detection – Hands-on 1 Training

This repository contains materials for a hands-on training on phishing detection using machine learning and explainable AI. Participants will explore EDA, train multiple models, evaluate their performance, and use both Streamlit and Flask apps for deployment and interpretability.

## 📊 Contents

### 1. **EDA Notebook**
- `notebooks/Phishing_EDA.ipynb`
- Feature exploration, visualizations, and detailed interpretation.

### 2. **Model Comparison**
- `notebooks/Compare_Models.ipynb`
- Side-by-side metrics and visual comparison of three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

### 3. **Model Training**
- `train_and_evaluate_all_models.py`
- Trains all models and stores results in `models/` and `metrics/` folders.

### 4. **Apps**
- `streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit UI with SHAP explanations
- `app.py`: Flask form-based app for prediction

## 🚀 Running in GitHub Codespaces

Codespaces automatically sets up the Python environment via `.devcontainer/`. Once the Codespace starts:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Alternatively, use the `Rebuild Container` option if dependencies were not automatically installed.

### 💡 Tips:
- Use the VS Code interface to open and run the notebooks.
- All files and folders are structured for easy exploration.

## 🔍 Running Apps

### 🔴 Streamlit
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### 🌐 Flask
```bash
python app.py
```

Both apps will allow participants to experiment with real predictions, SHAP visualizations, and natural language explanations.
